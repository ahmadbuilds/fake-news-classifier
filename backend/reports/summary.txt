Project Summary & Report

Project Goal:
    Build a machine learning pipeline to classify news articles as fake or real based on text content.

Data:
    Raw dataset: 
        Fake.csv and True.csv containing fake and real news articles.

    Processed dataset: 
        x_train.csv and y_train.csv for model training.

Preprocessing & Feature Engineering:

    Text preprocessing: 
        lowercasing, stopword removal, tokenization, and stemming.
        TF-IDF vectorization (uni-, bi-, and tri-grams).
        Categorical features (like subject) encoded via one-hot encoding.

Models & Evaluation:

    Trained models: 
        Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost.

    Random Forest performance (best model):
    Accuracy: ~99.8%
    Confusion Matrix shows very few misclassifications.
    Feature importance highlights key terms like "reuter", "washington", and "donald trump" as highly predictive.

Key Insights:

    Text content alone is highly predictive for distinguishing real vs fake news.
    Including additional features like publication date or subject could further improve interpretability.

The models can be deployed for real-time predictions with minimal preprocessing on new inputs.

Figures & Visualization:

    Distribution of articles by subject and time.
    Feature importance plots help explain model decisions.
